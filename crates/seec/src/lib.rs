//! # SEEC Executes Enormous Circuits
//!
//! This framework implements secure 2-party secret-sharing-based multi party computation protocols.
//! Currently, we implement the Boolean and arithmetic versions of GMW87 with multiplication triple preprocessing.
//! Additionally, we implement the Boolean part of the ABY2.0 protocol.
//!
//! ## Secure Multi-Party Computation
//! In secure multi-party computation (MPC), there are n parties, each with their private input x_i.
//! Given a public function f(x_1, ..., x_n), the parties execute a protocol Ï€ that correctly and
//! securely realizes the functionality f. In other words, at the end of the protocol, the parties know
//! the output of f, but have no information about the input of the other parties other than what is revealed
//! by the output itself. Currently, SEEC is limited to the n = 2 party case, also known as secure
//! two-party computation. We hope to extend this in the future to n parties.
//!
//! ### Security
//! The two most prevalent security models are
//! - semi-honest security, where an attacker can corrupt parties, but they follow the protocol as specified.
//! - malicious security, where corrupted parties can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol.
//!
//! SEEC currently only implements semi-honestly secure protocols (GMW, ABY2.0).
//!
//! ## Using SEEC
//! To use SEEC, you need a recent stable Rust toolchain (nightly on ARM[^nightly]). The easiest way to install Rust
//! is via the official toolchain installer [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
//!
//! Create a new Rust project using cargo `cargo new --bin seec-test`, and add SEEC as a dependency to your
//! `Cargo.toml`.
//! ```toml
//! # in seec-test/Cargo.toml
//! [dependencies]
//! seec = { git = "https://github.com/encryptogroup/SEEC.git", features = ["..."]}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Cargo features
//! - "bench-api": Enables the benchmarking API
//! - "aby2": Enables the ABY2 implementation
//! - "silent-ot-quasi-cyclic": Enables the Silent-OT QuasiCyclic code. depends on AVX2, therefore not platform independent.
//! - "silent-ot": Enables the Silent-OT codes from libOTe. These work on ARM.
//!
//! The following annotated example of using SEEC is also located at `crates/seec/examples/simple.rs`.
//! You can run it using `cargo run --example simple`.
//!```ignore,rust
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/simple.rs")]
//!```
//!
//! [^nightly]: If you are on an ARM platform, you need to install a recent nightly toolchain. After
//!             installing, we advise to issue `rustup override set nightly` in the top-level directory.
